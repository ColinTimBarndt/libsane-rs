# libsane-rs

Libsane-rs is a (safe) bindings crate for the [SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) document scanner library](https://gitlab.com/sane-project).

At this time, it only supports blocking reading, but support can and will be added in the future.

For prerequisites, see the individual crate's README file. Examples can be found at [libsane/examples](./libsane/examples/). Just clone the repository and run `cargo run --example <NAME>`.
